   - **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch in your fork for your contribution. Use a descriptive name for the branch, such as `bugfix/issue-123` or `feature/new-feature`.
     ```bash
     git checkout -b branch-name
     ```
   - **Make Your Changes**: Implement your changes locally in your branch. Ensure that your code adheres to the project’s coding standards.
